# Samurai Train Services

## Introduction

Samurai Train Services is a comprehensive backend system designed to manage train operations in Bangladesh. It features advanced user management with role-based access control (RBAC), secure password protection using hashing, and efficient train scheduling and route optimization.

The system supports real-time updates, integrates with digital wallets for seamless transactions, and provides a scalable, modular architecture for future enhancements. Initially I developed it for the Code Samurai 2024 Preliminary Round, it has since been expanded with additional functionalities to meet real-world needs and ensure robust performance and security.
